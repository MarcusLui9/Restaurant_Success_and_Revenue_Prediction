## Data
The Restaurant Success dataset from Kaggle includes 15 feature columns, 14 of which are useable for anaylsis. These features are both classified as categorical and numerical, and can be used to determine whether or not a restaurant would be a success. The goal of this analysis is to develop a model that would also predict a restaurant's revenue based on the features and factors given. This report may help new restaurant owners with how to set up a plan for success.
