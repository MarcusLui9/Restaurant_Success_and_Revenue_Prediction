# Restaurant Success and Revenue Prediction
## Business Goal
There is always a demand for restaurants regardless of where you decide to live. Sometimes, restaurants will open with the plan of staying open for a long period of time, but it does not always work out. Restaurants can close just as quickly and have a new one take its place. The goal of this analysis is to develop a predictive model that can determine restaurant success based on various factors. This can help new restaurant owners in identifying what strategies to deploy and how to achieve success and longevity.

## Data
The Restaurant Success dataset from Kaggle includes 15 feature columns, 14 of which are useable for anaylsis. These features are both classified as categorical and numerical, and can be used to determine whether or not a restaurant would be a success.
